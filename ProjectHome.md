Videogame developed for the Master in 'Design and development of Videogames', Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

The game is the typical beat'em up Double Dragon style, but with 3D graphics and cartoon style. Oh yeah, and you are the bad guy! A huge violent bad guy... A heavy metal soundtrack will surround you while you, a huge wyvern (dragon like creature) will try to destroy the land you live in (and of course its inhabitants) trying to save your princess. Princess used to live with you, a huge drunkard monster, and LOVE you. But the prince charming, as usual, succeeded in the attempt of 'saving' the princess, . Of course she didn't like it... You gotta get her back! A lot of humor and and a lot of blood, women and beer!
